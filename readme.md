Did not complete the "anagrams" puzzle. Spent too much time on SQL and JQuery and not enough time on "Marie eats an apple". If I had more time, I'd try this solution: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7167634/ruby-anagram-solver

JSFiddle for my JQuery questions: https://jsfiddle.net/so45m0to/

Note: I did not complete the Javascript MyTree portion. I have no experience write pure JS.

Always feeling this was an area I lacked (especially with the new JS frameworks), last week I signed up for the following courses:

Regarding CSS, I've been using Bootstrap and Zurb Foundation from the start. I can, if needed, write decent CSS, but I prefer to leave design up to designer and backend up to backend.
